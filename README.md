Tap Match game approach, by Bernat Vidal

About

This is a Tap Match game developed in Unity2D, that uses physics to provide a funnier and more satisfying experience to the user, as well as simplify grid related systems, while approaching DreamBlastâ€™s game features. Just set the rows, columns and color variety you want on the Game Manager, and enjoy!

The approach implements a game events system to avoid instances the necessity to know each other, while laying the foundations for a modular architecture.

Multiple pooling-handling system is used to improve overall performance of the game, while providing scalability.

The algorithm used to detect Matches is a simplified Deep-First Search algorithm.

Matchable popping animations and user punctuation feedback are added to improve game enjoyability.
